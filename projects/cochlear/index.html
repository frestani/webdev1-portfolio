      <h2>What is a cochlear implant?</h2>
      <p>The picture above is a digital rendition of what a cochlear implant looks like. Cochlear implants are used to provide a sense of hearing for people with severe/profound hearing loss.</p>

      <h2>How do cochlear implants work?</h2>
      <p>Cochlear implants work by using magnets, an array of electrodes, a microphone, and a sound processor. The first magnet is inserted above a person's ear in between their skin and their skull. The second magnet is on the coil of the cochlear implant. When these two are connected, the microphone picks up noise and sends it through the processor, which then goes into an array of ~23 electrodes in the cochlea.</p>

    <h2>Close-up of Magnets</h2>
        
      <p>Shown above is the external magnet and the internal magnet. After surgery, imlant users have to wait three to six weeks to activate both magnets. Once the user can wear the cochlear implant, they are able to hear at nearly the same level of people who aren't deaf.</p>
